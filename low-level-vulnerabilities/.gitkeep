I will cover the following topics in this folder 'low-level-vulnerabilities':  

Binary Exploitation Vulnerabilities (Low-Level):  
➡ Buffer Overflow – Overwriting the return address using extra input.  
➡ Format String Attack – Exploiting uncontrolled format specifiers to leak or overwrite memory.  
➡ Use-After-Free (UAF) – Accessing memory after it has been freed.  
➡ Integer Overflow/Underflow – Causing unexpected behavior by exceeding integer limits.  
➡ Race Condition – Multiple processes competing for a shared resource.  
➡ Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) – Reusing existing code through stack overflow.  
➡ Heap Overflow – Corrupting heap memory by exceeding allocated space.
